# 👋 Adonis Jimenez — IT Support Technician leveling up into QA, Data, and DevOps

I’m Adonis (@mr-adonis-jimenez) — a South Florida IT Support Technician evolving from frontline troubleshooting into the deeper engineering stack.  
By day I keep systems resilient and users productive. By night I break things, fix things, automate things, and build the technical muscle that gets me one step closer to QA Engineering, Data Engineering, and DevOps.
